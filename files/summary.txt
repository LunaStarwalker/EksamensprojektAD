Uncle Hades sees his beautiful niece, Persephone, and thinks "she"s the one" so he goes to his brother, Zeus, who is Persephone's dad, and asks for Persephone to be his bride. Hades then decides to then burst from the ground with a chariot while Persephone is minding her damn business picking flowers with some nymph friends (relatable), snatches Persephone and drags her down into the underworld.
