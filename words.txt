Because so many original written sources have been lost and because of the oral nature of myths, there are often varied versions of major stories. That, combined with our modern interpretation, has led the gods of many mythologies to mean whatever the current climate needs them to mean. Christianity, feminism, paganism, Percy Jackson, have all changed the way we have viewed the Greek Gods. One of the female deities that have taken multiple forms in the past few years is Persephone, with the most common change being her relationship with husband/uncle, Hades. Growing up I read several different versions of the "Rape of Persephone" as it is often called (rape in this context is synonymous with abduction, rather than the sexual act, which is often called "ravished"). Uncle Hades sees his beautiful niece, Persephone, and thinks "she"s the one" so he goes to his brother, Zeus, who is Persephone's dad, and asks for Persephone to be his bride. Zeus knows that this will make Demeter, Persephone's mother/Zeus' sister, very upset and therefore softly consents to it, without telling anyone. Hades then decides to then burst from the ground with a chariot while Persephone is minding her damn business picking flowers with some nymph friends (relatable), snatches Persephone and drags her down into the underworld. Not the best first impression. What follows is very Disney's Beauty and the Beast-esque, Hades tries to woo Persephone with all the glitz and glamour of being first lady of the underworld. Hades is the god of wealth after all. However, kidnapped gold is not at shiny as freedom gold. Demeter was not happy that Zeus would not return Demeter to her and being the goddess of the harvest, she played her trump card: starvation. After hearing people complain long enough, Zeus sent Hermes out to reclaim Persephone. Hades, deciding that he called dibs and wasn't giving up his lady, tricked her into eating six pomegranate seeds which forced Persephone to stay in the underworld for six months out of the year (and that's why we have the seasons, yay). It varies in who does the tricking. Sometimes it's Hades, sometimes it's Hermes and sometimes it's some underworld creature, butâ€¦ sometimes it's Persephone who makes the decision to eat the seeds herself. And that question of choice has led to many "alternative character interpretations" about Persephone, her relationships with Demeter and Hades, and how much autonomy she really has before and after her kidnapping.
